# ActionFlix Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive architectural documentation for ActionFlix using the **4+1 Architectural View Model**. This model provides multiple perspectives on the system architecture to address the concerns of different stakeholders.

## What is the 4+1 Model?

The 4+1 architectural view model organizes the description of a software architecture using five concurrent views:

```
                    ┌─────────────────┐
                    │   Scenarios     │
                    │   (Use Cases)   │
                    │      "+1"       │
                    └────────┬────────┘
                             │
                 ┌───────────┼───────────┐
                 │           │           │
        ┌────────▼──────┐    │    ┌─────▼──────────┐

## How to Use This Documentation

### For New Developers
1. Start with **[Scenarios](05-scenarios.md)** to understand what the system does
2. Read **[Logical View](01-logical-view.md)** to understand the code structure
3. Review **[Development View](03-development-view.md)** to set up your environment
4. Consult other views as needed for specific concerns

### For Architects
1. Review all views to understand the complete architecture
2. Use as reference when making architectural decisions
3. Update relevant views when architecture changes

### For Operations/DevOps
1. Focus on **[Physical View](04-physical-view.md)** for deployment
2. Reference **[Development View](03-development-view.md)** for build processes
3. Check **[Process View](02-process-view.md)** for runtime characteristics

### For Product Managers

2. Consult **[Physical View](04-physical-view.md)** for deployment options
3. Reference other views for technical constraints and possibilities

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Security by Design
- **Process Isolation**: Electron's main/renderer separation
- **Minimal Privileges**: Renderer has no direct Node.js access
- **Secure Communication**: IPC via contextBridge only
- **API Key Protection**: Environment variables preferred

### 2. Simplicity
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only essential libraries
- **Flat Structure**: Easy to navigate codebase
- **Direct Communication**: No complex middleware
- **Local-First**: All data stored locally

### 3. User Experience
- **Responsive UI**: Non-blocking operations
- **Progress Feedback**: Real-time transformation updates
- **Error Clarity**: Clear error messages with guidance
- **Netflix Aesthetic**: Familiar, polished interface

### 4. Extensibility
- **Plugin Points**: Easy to add new AI models
- **Language Support**: Extensible language options
- **View System**: Easy to add new UI sections
- **API Abstraction**: Easy to swap or add APIs

## Technology Stack

### Python CLI
- **Runtime**: Python 3.8+
- **API Client**: OpenAI SDK
- **HTTP**: requests library
- **Images**: Pillow

### Electron Desktop
- **Framework**: Electron 28+
- **Runtime**: Node.js 18+
- **API Clients**: OpenAI SDK, axios
- **Storage**: electron-store
- **UI**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS

## Key Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Local-First Architecture
**Rationale**: Simplicity, privacy, and offline capabilities
- No backend server required
- All data stored on user's machine
- No database setup needed
- User has full control of data

### Decision 2: Electron for Desktop
**Rationale**: Cross-platform with modern UI
- Single codebase for Windows, macOS, Linux
- Leverages web technologies
- Easy to build Netflix-style UI
- Good developer experience

### Decision 3: Sequential API Calls
**Rationale**: Simplicity and context preservation
- Title generated first
- Summary uses generated title for context
- Poster uses both title and summary
- Clear progress indication (33%, 66%, 100%)
- **Trade-off**: Longer total time vs. better quality

### Decision 4: File-Based Collections
**Rationale**: Simplicity and portability
- No database setup required
- Easy to backup (just copy folder)
- Human-readable (README.md)
- Easy to share collections
- **Trade-off**: Slower loading for many collections

## Future Architecture Considerations

### Potential Enhancements

1. **Parallel API Calls**
   - Generate title and summary concurrently
   - Reduce total transformation time by 30-50%
   - Trade-off: Summary may not reference exact action-packed title

2. **Database Integration**
   - SQLite for faster collection queries
   - Enable searching and filtering
   - Track transformation history
   - Trade-off: Increased complexity

3. **Cloud Sync**
   - Optional cloud backup of collections
   - Sync across multiple devices
   - Share collections with others
   - Trade-off: Privacy concerns, cost

4. **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**
   - Cache generated posters
   - Reduce redundant API calls
   - Share popular transformations
   - Trade-off: Centralized service needed

5. **Microservices Architecture**
   - Separate API gateway
   - Dedicated transformation service
   - Rate limiting and queue management
   - Trade-off: Much higher complexity
